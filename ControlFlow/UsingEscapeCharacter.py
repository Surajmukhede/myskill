# use escape character 

# The escape characters \' and \" let you put single quotes and double quotes inside your strings

print("Coder's life") # string literals
# Or
print('codr\'s life')

# printing each line using \n character
print('myself Suraj Mukhede\nI\'m currently 27 year old\nI\'m Web Developer')

# using Raw string by putting r before beggining of quotations

print(r'codr\'s life') 
# A raw string completely ignores all escape characters and
#prints any backslash that appears in the string
